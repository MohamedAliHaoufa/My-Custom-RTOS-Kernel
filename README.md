# My-Custom-RTOS-Scheduler-for-Smart-Car-Management-on-STM32F401VE

## Short Description  
Preemptive RTOS scheduler for ARM Cortex‑M4 (STM32F401VE), optimized for smart car management systems

---

## Long Description  
**My Custom RTOS Scheduler for Smart Car Management on STM32F401VE** is a lightweight, preemptive real‑time kernel engineered specifically for ARM Cortex‑M4 microcontrollers. Designed with automotive‑grade precision in mind, this scheduler provides deterministic task management, minimal latency, and an ultra‑small memory footprint, making it ideal for embedded control in smart car management systems. The scheduler core is written in C, ensuring portability across all Cortex‑M4 devices, and features:

- **Priority‑based Scheduling:** Implements a fixed‑priority preemptive algorithm with round‑robin time slicing to guarantee timely task execution.  
- **Dynamic Task Management:** Supports runtime task creation, deletion, and priority adjustment for flexible application workflows.  
- **Inter‑Task Synchronization:** Includes mutexes, semaphores, and event flags to coordinate resource sharing without race conditions.  
- **Low Overhead:** Optimized context switch routines and configurable tick rates yield a minimal RAM and flash footprint.  

This project comes with comprehensive documentation, example integrations for smart car sensor and actuator modules, and a modular architecture that allows easy extension or adaptation to other Cortex‑M4 platforms.

## Key Highlights  
- **Target Platform:** STM32F401VE (ARM Cortex‑M4) and compatible Cortex‑M4 MCUs.  
- **Use Case:** Embedded control for smart car management, including real‑time sensor sampling, actuator control, and communication scheduling.  
- **Language & Toolchain:**  C (GNU11), GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc), CMSIS-compliant startup code.​

This update adds a dedicated **Project File Structure** section to clearly document the repository layout, and refines the **Getting Started** instructions to align with that structure—covering cloning, configuration, build, and flash steps using CMake and the GCC ARM Embedded toolchain.

## Getting Started  
Follow these steps to clone, configure, build, and flash the scheduler on an STM32F401VE (or any Cortex‑M4 MCU):

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Install [GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)  
   - Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a supported build system (e.g., Ninja or Make)  
   - (Optional) Install ST‑LINK tools for flashing

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/My-Custom-RTOS-Scheduler-for-Smart-Car-Management-on-STM32F401VE.git
   cd My-Custom-RTOS-Scheduler-for-Smart-Car-Management-on-STM32F401VE
   ```

3. **Configure the Build**  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build && cd build
   cmake .. -DMCU=STM32F401VE
   ```

4. **Build the Project**  
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. **Flash to Target**  
   ```bash
   # Adjust path/name of the generated binary as needed
   st-flash write bin/firmware.bin 0x08000000
   ```

6. **Run Tests**  
   ```bash
   cd ../tests
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```
